# Gunfigurator
Localized Gunbot Configuration interface written in all all native web code. (Pure HTML/CSS/JS)

## NOTICE
### Gunfigrator is updated for Gunbot v. 4.0.5 - In each release candidate as of recently, new parameters have been added.
### It is possible that if you use Gunfigurator for a different 4.0.x version of Gunbot, it may throw errors.
### I am working now to make a 'Version Switcher' for Gunfigurator to avoid this confusion.
### Report bugs!
